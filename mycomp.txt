Hello this is my practice to GitHub Project. 

I will be typing some things now as said by my firends:

Chase: My frog can jump higher than your frog

Elise: Well that's called a capsize 

Anmol: I am looking forward to winter break becasue christmas is my favorite holiday, and i get to see the most important people in my life, my family. NOTE: she really made me work for that. 

Chase: Get back behind the podium Jackson, the teleprompter is running.
